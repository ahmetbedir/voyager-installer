# Voyager Installer

This is similar to the Laravel Installer; however, it will prompt you for your database credentials and install a fresh copy of Voyager.

You can install this globally on your machine by running:

```
composer global require "ahmetbedir/voyager-installer"
```

Then you can add run:

```
voyager new folder-name
```

And a new voyager install will be added to the folder-name :)
